# Weather App

## Description

Weather App based on openweather's API.

Javascript, HTML and CSS has been used alongside Node and Express to host openweather requests and hide the API key on the server side.

Mapbox geocoder has been implemented for location queries.

I have also used the opportunity to explore SASS and use Autoprefixer.
